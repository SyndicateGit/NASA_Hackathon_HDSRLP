# NASA_Hackathon_HDSRLP
NASA Space Apps Challenge Hackathon

HDSRLP (High Definition Space Rocket Launch Program) is an acrynom created from each of our teammate's first name. 
We're all students from the University of Toronto doing our first hackathon!

We're planning on making a kids design your own rocket web game.
